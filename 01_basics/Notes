"use strict"; --> This is used to make sure what ever the JS code we write has to be in the newer version

alert(3+3) --> We are using the Node js ,not browser .So different syntax has to bbe used

Readbility has to be good when using the JS

MDN for JS syntax
tc39.cs defines the standards for the JS

Below are basic data  types available

string ==> "Ravi"
number ==>  2 to power 53 
bigInt ==>
boolean  ==>  true/false
null ==> standalone value as well as datatype in JS ----? when we use typeof null it gives us as object
undefined ==> you defined a variable ,but there is no value assigned to it
        let state;
        console.log(state)
 here in above case we get it as undefined

 symbol ==> to identify the uniqueness
 object

 console.log(typeof "ravi");--> typeof is used to get the whar type is the data
let a=25
console.log(typeof(a));
